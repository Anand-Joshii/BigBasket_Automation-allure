# BigBasketAutomation-Allure Reports
Hello there, I have created a simple test automation for Big Basket website.
I have used Selenium TestNG and Data-Driven(using excel file) frameworks to automate an E2E scenario(Happy path) of the website.
I have used maven quickstart project to make this happen. There are 2 POM files in which only one can be used to run this by using maven commands due to authentication step in one of the POM file involves entering data from your phones text message(otp).
I have used Allure Reports for reporting results of Test scenario and also have implemented ITestListner for the same.
Have a look and let me know if there are any changes that can be made to these scripts for better results.
I will be adding few more test scenarios in the future. For now I have just added only one E2E scenario and few simple assertions.
