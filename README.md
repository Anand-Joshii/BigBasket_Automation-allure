# BigBasketAutomation-Allure Reports
Hello there, I have created a simple test automation for Big Basket website.
I have used Selenium TestNG and Data-Driven(using excel file) frameworks to automate an E2E scenario(Happy path) of the website.
I have used maven quickstart project to make this happen. There are 2 POM files in which only one can be used to run this by using maven commands due to authentication step which involves entering data from your phones text message(otp).
I have used Allure Reports for reporting results of Test scenario and also have implemented ITestListner for the same.
Have a look and let me know if there are any changes that can be made to these scripts for better results.
I will be adding few more test scenarios in the future. For now I have just added only one E2E scenario and few simple assertions.
